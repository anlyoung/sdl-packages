# sdl_interface

Package for code and classes related to interfacing with the sdl robot. Based on `https://github.com/RethinkRobotics/baxter_interface.git`

As of 6 August 2021, the`limb.py` class with the `set_joint_positions()` function works as expected by using the `controller_handoff.py` node.
